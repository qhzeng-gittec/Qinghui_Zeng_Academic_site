# Statement of Purpose

During the first two years of my university studies, the courses focused on proving theorems using mathematical approaches. However, I struggled to understand these theorems intuitively and geometrically. It was during my physics classes, particularly with electric and magnetic fields, that I found a beautiful connection to the concepts I learned in my mathematical analysis courses, such as the divergence and curl theorems. This realization helped me see how many mathematical theories are closely related to the laws governing the world and represent generalizations of physical phenomena. Beyond theoretical modeling, I have also observed CFD simulations of fluid motion, where complex turbulence and vortices are modeled. This made me realize that computational methods can also aid in studying intricate physical phenomena.

To prepare for the graduate study, I took a series of foundational mathematics courses, such as Real Analysis, Differential Geometry, and Topology. Real Analysis, for example, introduced me to Lebesgue integration, a powerful tool for handling functions with complex properties. These courses laid the groundwork for future studies in Partial Differential Equations (PDE) and higher-level probability theory. Differential Geometry and Topology became important tools for understanding how to define PDEs on complex manifolds by establishing coordinate charts and differential structures. I also took courses in Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), learning methods for proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions and studying Lyapunov stability analysis.


One of my most impactful projects stemmed from my previous research on wave propagation in waveguides, which utilized the DtN method combined with finite basis function expansions. During this research, I realized that obtaining high-precision eigenmodes at each discrete point was key, but the standard finite difference methods could not meet this demand due to limitations in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this challenge, I began studying eigenmode computation techniques in more depth.

Under the guidance of Professor Zhu Jianxin, I proposed a method that approximated the coefficients of the equation using piecewise quadratic polynomials. In each subinterval, the Kummer functions analytically solve the transformed Sturm-Liouville problem. This method had been applied in waveguides separated by flat interface, but extending it to waveguides with curved interfaces introduced complex boundary conditions and produced by transformations in both the equations and coordinates, particularly in simplifying the dispersion relation to derive approximate solutions, which serves as initial values for numerical solver. Initially, I attempted to solve the problem directly from a theoretical standpoint, but the results were overly complex and difficult to apply. It wasn’t until I implemented the approximated solution in code that I discovered hidden relationships within the equation coefficients, significantly simplifying the dispersion relation.

Building on this discovery, the iterative solvers, such as the Müller method, can quickly converge to accurate eigenvalues. This work not only extended the applicability of existing numerical solvers to more complex waveguides but also solved the critical problem of unreliable initial guesses in previous methods.

From a technical perspective, this project taught me the academic standards of writing research papers, and I also gained proficiency in using Mathematica for complex formula derivations and MATLAB for programming. I am currently revising this paper and plan to seek publication opportunities. However, I later realized that directly approximating the coefficients of the characteristic equation using piecewise quadratic interpolation was not the most optimal approach, given that the coefficients are in a rational form (f/g). I devised a more refined method by first approximating f and g separately using quadratic interpolation, then applying a least-squares method to approximate f/g with a quadratic function. This approach further reduces the error in the coefficient approximation.

Another project I worked on with Professor Zhu Jianxin involved extending the DtN algorithm from 2D to 3D waveguides, which required expanding the transverse direction from one-dimensional to two-dimensional space. This involved a deep understanding of operator spectral expansion and operator operations. To grasp these concepts, I studied functional analysis and realized that operator spectral theory is closely related to matrix eigenvalue theory, both of which are grounded in the structure of Hilbert spaces. This connection helped me appreciate the abstract and universal nature of mathematical theories.

To understand the radiation conditions in the paper, I delved into PDE analytical methods and applied Fourier transforms in the transverse directions. I discovered that each condition corresponds to modes propagating outward at large distances. With this foundation, I quickly derived the radiation condition for the 3D waveguide propagation direction and extended the inner product of function spaces from one-dimensional integrals to double integrals. I then followed the methodology from the original paper to derive the equations governing the expansion coefficients in the DtN algorithm. The numerical results closely matched the exact solutions obtained through the separation of variables method, validating my extension. Although I did not write this work into a paper, this experience deepened my understanding of various mathematical theories and further fueled my interest in applying mathematics to solve physical equations.


Earlier in my studies, I explored the use of machine learning to solve PDEs. During my junior year, I attended a discussion class organized by Professor Zheng Xiaoning on fluid dynamics and computational methods, where I encountered techniques such as (Physics informed neural network)PINN, (deep operator neural network)DeepONet, and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), as well as model reduction techniques proposed by Karen Willcox. I noticed that many machine learning methods did not directly incorporate physical principles, and I began questioning whether neural networks truly learned the underlying physical laws. While these methods were sufficient from an applied perspective, I felt they lacked elegance from a theoretical standpoint.

Inspired by the Koopman Neural Operator, I proposed a method to use neural networks to approximate discrete spatial derivatives. I trained a CNN to learn spatial derivatives of various orders from snapshots, feeding these derivative values into a fully connected network to simulate nonlinear interactions. I then applied an Euler method for time integration. This architecture aligns with the principles of the Navier-Stokes equations, where the evolution of physical quantities depends on their interactions with the surrounding medium: convection and diffusion.
Although the initial results using NS equation solutions as training data were not successful, I devised several improvement strategies. One approach was inspired by the multi-step method, where I transformed the CNN into a multi-channel model that predicts the next snapshot based on multiple previous snapshots. Another improvement was to initialize the CNN kernels based on the equation structure and pre-train the fully connected network. I also considered adding conservation conditions to the loss function to ensure that the flux across all computational units in a closed system sums to zero.  
Through discussions with my professors, I realized that before tackling complex problems like the NS equations, it is important to start with simpler cases and gradually test and refine the models. 

These experiences have solidified my desire to pursue graduate studies. I am fascinated by the complex behaviors that emerge from nonlinear phenomena, especially in the context of partial differential equations. Nonlinear systems often exhibit intricate dynamics such as bifurcations, chaos, and shock formation, which make their analysis far more challenging than linear systems. To tackle these complexities, I plan to develop a multifaceted approach. On the analytical side, I will explore the stability and sensitivity of nonlinear systems through perturbation analysis and Lyapunov stability methods. On the computational side, I aim to design advanced numerical algorithms to simulate nonlinear phenomena with high accuracy and efficiency. I hope the work will advancing our ability to model and predict a wide range of physical systems, like fluid dynamics and wave propagation.
