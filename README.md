# About Me

Greetings! I am Qinghui, a student currently a undergraduate of Science program in Information and Computational Science at Jinan University in Guangzhou, China. I am in the forth year of the college study, so I am seeking opportunities for graduate studies in applied or computation mathematics.

If you wish to reach out to me, feel free to contact me via email at [zengqh23@outlook.com](mailto:zengqh23@outlook.com).

## Educational Background

During my undergraduate studies, I have taken a variety of math courses that have enhanced my mathematical abilities. Some of these courses include Numerical Analysis, Topology, Real Analysis, Differential Geometry, Applied Complex Analysis, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Multivariable Statistics. The grades of some courses are provided in here (https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/coursegrades.md). These courses had not only proved essential tools for solving research problems, but they have also revealed the beauty of interconnected mathematical theories, making me even more interested in math. 

## Academic Passions

My main academic interests revolve around applied mathematics, encompassing areas such as control theory, numerical methods, and differential equations. Presently, I am especially interested by Mathematical Physics, which involves developing mathematical frameworks for physics or numerical methods to address physics-related equations. I am drawn to the simplicity of mathematics and its alignment with physical phenomena, which underscores the potency of mathematics. You can read more about why I am so interested in math and physics here(https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/reasrch_interest.md) One specific domain that captivates me is fluid dynamics, with its array of unsolved challenges like the Navier-Stokes equation's behavior during laminar-to-turbulent transitions. Besides, I find aircrafts really cool! 

## Projects Overview
Here are some small projects I have done during my undergraduate study, although some did not become paper, but they are interesting trial! From my research experience, I have summerized a few methods about how to do research(https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/research_experience.md)

### Data-Driven Time-Dependent PDE Solver(https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/data_driven_pde_solver.md)
A technique that leverages neural networks to approximate solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations, integrating concepts from universal approximation theorems, traditional time-marching schemes, and reduced-order modeling methods.

### Data-Driven PDE Solver of Finite Basis Representation(https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/finite_basis_neural_solver.md)
Similar to the finite element method, this approach determines coefficients for a finite set of functions to approximate solutions. Neural networks are utilized to "learn" these coefficients from provided data and a set of basis functions.

### Convenient Basis Transformation for Operator Marching Scheme for Helmholtz Equation
The operator marching scheme is an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation. However, efficient basis conversion is vital when eigenfunctions evolve along time steps. By exploiting the orthogonality between the eigenfunctions of the conjugate operator and the Helmholtz operator, a streamlined basis conversion process can be implemented.

Since I am still working on this project, A more detailed description will be presented later.

## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, my ambition is to pursue a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. I aim to contribute to the field of mathematical physics by formulating new theories that enhance our comprehension of intricate physical phenomena, be it in fluid dynamics or astrophysics. I am enthusiastic about my forthcoming academic endeavors and the prospect of collaborating with experts while engaging in advanced research.
