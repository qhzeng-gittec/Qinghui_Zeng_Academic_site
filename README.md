# About Me

Hi! I'm Qinghui, an undergraduate student in the Science program of Information and Computational Science at Jinan University in Guangzhou, China. I am in my fourth year of college, and I am looking for opportunities for graduate studies in applied or computational mathematics.

If you wish to reach out to me, feel free to contact me via email at [zengqh23@outlook.com](mailto:zengqh23@outlook.com).

## Educational Background

During my undergraduate studies, I have taken a variety of math courses that have enhanced my mathematical abilities. Some of these courses include Numerical Analysis, Topology, Real Analysis, Differential Geometry, Applied Complex Analysis, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Multivariable Statistics. The grades of some courses are provided [here](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/coursegrades.md). These courses have not only been essential tools for solving research problems, but they have also shown me the beauty of interconnected mathematical theories, making me even more interested in math.

## Academic Passions

My main academic interests revolve around applied mathematics, including areas like control theory, numerical methods, and differential equations. Right now, I am especially interested in Mathematical Physics, which involves developing mathematical frameworks for physics or creating numerical methods to solve physics-related problems. I am drawn to the simplicity of mathematics and how it explains physical phenomena, which shows the power of math. You can read more about why I am so interested in math and physics [here](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/reasrch_interest.md). One specific area that fascinates me is fluid dynamics, with its many unsolved challenges like understanding the Navier-Stokes equation's behavior during laminar-to-turbulent transitions. Also, I find aircraft really cool!

## Projects Overview

Here are some small projects I have done during my undergraduate studies. While some did not become papers, they were interesting trials! From my research experience, I have summarized a few methods on [how to do research](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/research_experience.md).

### [Data-Driven Time-Dependent PDE Solver](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/data_driven_pde_solver.md)

A technique that uses neural networks to approximate solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations by combining ideas from universal approximation theorems, traditional time-marching schemes, and reduced-order modeling methods.

### [Data-Driven PDE Solver of Finite Basis Representation](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/finite_basis_neural_solver.md)

Similar to the finite element method, this approach determines coefficients for a finite set of functions to approximate solutions. Neural networks "learn" these coefficients from data and a set of basis functions.

### Convenient Basis Transformation for Operator Marching Scheme for Helmholtz Equation

The operator marching scheme is an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation. However, efficient basis conversion is important when eigenfunctions change over time. By using the orthogonality between the eigenfunctions of the conjugate operator and the Helmholtz operator, a more streamlined basis conversion process can be implemented.

Since I am still working on this project, a more detailed description will be presented later.

### Machine learning model for gene expression prediction
I am also collaborating with a group of students to use machine learning models to gain a deeper understanding of gene expression. My responsibilities include implementing code and conducting experiments. You can read more about this project [here](https://github.com/JasonLinjc/Seinformer).


## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. I want to contribute to mathematical physics by developing new theories that help us understand complex physical phenomena, whether in fluid dynamics or astrophysics. I am excited about my future academic journey and the chance to work with experts and doing advanced research!
