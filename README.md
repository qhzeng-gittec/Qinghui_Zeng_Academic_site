# About Me

Greetings! I am Qinghui, a student currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program in Information and Computational Science at Jinan University in Guangzhou, China. I am seeking opportunities for graduate studies in applied mathematics.

If you wish to reach out to me, feel free to contact me via email at [zengqh23@outlook.com](mailto:zengqh23@outlook.com).

## Educational Background

During my undergraduate studies, I have engaged in a variety of captivating courses that have enhanced my mathematical abilities. Some of these courses include Numerical Analysis, Topology, Real Analysis, Differential Geometry, Applied Complex Analysis, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Multivariable Statistics. Not only have these courses proved beneficial in solving research problems, but they have also revealed the beauty of interconnected mathematical theories, bringing me immense joy in learning.

## Academic Passions

My main academic interests revolve around applied mathematics, encompassing areas such as control theory, numerical methods, and differential equations. I believe in exploring a broad spectrum of subjects before honing in on a particular interest. Presently, I am especially intrigued by Mathematical Physics, which involves developing mathematical frameworks for physics or devising numerical methods to address physics-related equations. I am drawn to the intuitive nature of mathematics and its alignment with physical phenomena, which underscores the potency of mathematics. One specific domain that captivates me is fluid dynamics, with its array of unsolved challenges like the Navier-Stokes equation's behavior during laminar-to-turbulent transitions.

On a lighter note, I have a keen fascination with rockets and supersonic aircraft; they never fail to impress me!

Below, I have outlined a few small projects I have undertaken. For more detailed insights, please refer to my posts. I hope you find them engaging!

## Projects Overview

### Data-Driven Time-Dependent PDE Solver
A technique that leverages neural networks to approximate solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations, integrating concepts from universal approximation theorems, traditional time-marching schemes, and reduced-order modeling methods.

### Data-Driven PDE Solver of Finite Basis Representation
Similar to the finite element method, this approach determines coefficients for a finite set of functions to approximate solutions. Neural networks are utilized to "learn" these coefficients from provided data and a set of basis functions.

### Convenient Basis Transformation for Operator Marching Scheme for Helmholtz Equation
The operator marching scheme is an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation. However, efficient basis conversion is vital when eigenfunctions evolve along time steps. By exploiting the orthogonality between the eigenfunctions of the conjugate operator and the Helmholtz operator, a streamlined basis conversion process can be implemented.

## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, my ambition is to pursue a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. I aim to contribute to the field of mathematical physics by formulating new theories that enhance our comprehension of intricate physical phenomena, be it in fluid dynamics or astrophysics. I am enthusiastic about my forthcoming academic endeavors and the prospect of collaborating with experts while engaging in advanced research.
