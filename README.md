## Projects Overview


### Approximating Dispersion Relations in a Stratified Waveguide with a Curved Interface in an Open Domain, and Computing Eigenpairs

The Helmholtz equation is commonly used to model wave propagation. Previous work has utilized an orthogonal coordinate transformation to flatten the curved interface and applied Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) to truncate the open domain for finite computational regions. However, the transformation introduces variable coefficients to the Helmholtz equation, complicating the analysis. Building on research that employs piecewise Kummer functions to approximate eigenfunctions under varying refractive indices, I adapted this method to the transformed Helmholtz equation, deriving an approximate dispersion relation for the eigenpairs. By developing asymptotic solutions, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be computed numerically using Muller's method.

### [Hybrid Time-Marching with Neural Network Approach for Solving Nonlinear PDEs ](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/data_driven_pde_solver.md)

This project explores a hybrid time-marching approach that integrates neural networks with traditional numerical methods to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to approximate spatial derivatives and incorporating time-marching schemes like Euler's method, the approach aims to combine data-driven techniques with physically meaningful temporal evolution.

### [Data-Driven PDE Solver of Finite Basis Representation](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/finite_basis_neural_solver.md)

This project explores using neural networks to solve PDEs by representing solutions with locally supported spline basis functions. Inspired by the finite element method (FEM), where local basis functions approximate solutions, the research aims to train a neural network to learn the coefficients of these splines.

The aboves are some small projects I have done during my undergraduate studies. While some did not become papers, they were interesting trials to find out my interests. From my research experience, I have summarized a few methods on [how to do research](https://github.com/qhzeng-gittec/helloitisqinghui/blob/main/projects/research_experience.md).
