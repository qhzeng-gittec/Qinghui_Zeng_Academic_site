# Navigating the Complexities of Research: Lessons from My Undergraduate Journey

My experience in the research field, particularly in applied mathematics, has provided me with numerous opportunities to explore complex problems, navigate obstacles, and develop strategies to overcome them. Through these experiences, I've learned not only the technical skills necessary to conduct research but also the critical thinking and persistence required to push through difficulties. In this blog, I aim to share some of the key challenges I've encountered during my research projects, as well as the strategies and insights I've developed to address them.

These experiences might be suitable only for simple undergraduate projects; I will consider them more carefully before adopting them in graduate studies.

## Reading Papers
Reading a large number of papers is essential before working on a specific project, as it helps build a comprehensive view of the field of study and introduces common methods people are using, which are applicable in my own research project.  
I have summarized some efficient ways of reading research papers from my own experience. Below are some of them.

### Understanding Backgrounds
The background includes the problems the paper tries to handle, the theoretical results already established in this area, and the mathematical tools it uses.  
Often, a mentor would send me papers introducing new methods, but the paper assumes the reader has a well-rounded background in the area, which can be really confusing for a beginner. For example, when I first read a paper about computing wave transfer problems, I was really confused about the problem setting and the physical background, like wave number, radiation condition, reflection, propagating modes, and incident waves.  
The papers it cited for background reference were also abstruse. To quickly prepare for the project, I divided these theoretical backgrounds into two parts: fundamental mathematical and physical knowledge, and advanced knowledge in acoustic studies. Just like the lower and upper division courses in university, the first part is usually more crucial for understanding because the second part of knowledge is often derived from it. I would search for textbooks and read that particular chapter. For example, one paper contains lots of derivations based on Hilbert Space and its inner product. So I looked them up in a Functional Analysis textbook, focusing on the theory while omitting the detailed proofs for efficiency reasons.  
For the second part of knowledge, they are much harder to grasp. Some are actually courses for engineering major students. I once tried to understand everything I came across. I wanted to derive the distribution of the eigenvalues of the stratified Helmholtz operator after adding a perfectly matched layer (PML), which confused me for a long time. I read many papers that spanned a long time period from the 1970s to the 2000s. Later, I understood it is a difficult subject, too difficult for an undergraduate. I also found that it is not a key point in my project, and using the result of that theory is fine. So I think it is better to simply accept those deep theories sometimes, for efficiency purposes.

### Omitted Derivations
Many papers, especially in mathematics, omit some steps during proofs and derivations, maybe because the author considers them simple. However, if key mathematical tools are not in mind, the omitted steps could be obstacles. Instead of getting stuck with your own knowledge, consulting the mentor about whether specific math theory should be applied might solve the problem faster. I have experienced such difficulties a few times; at first, I thought it was because I was not smart enough. But after I asked my mentor for help, it turned out to be because of a theory I did not know before.

### Setting Priorities for Papers
A large number of papers are published every day, especially if the area is developing fast. But not every paper should be read carefully; only those you find inspiring should be paid more attention to. In the data-driven physics modeling area, it is very popular, with many scholars publishing new papers. But a large proportion of them have only limited contributions. My reading strategy for papers in this field is to first scroll through them, examine the model structure and experimental results, then use simple words to summarize their contribution. If I consider it trivial, then I will no longer think about it too much. But if the method sounds ingenious, I will further read more about its theoretical background, its motivation, and the reasons for the improvement. For example, the paper on the Koopman Neural Operator left me with a deep impression. The idea of integrating Koopman operator theory into machine learning is quite innovative and showed me that properly integrating mathematical frameworks could really enhance machine learning performance.

### The Limitations of Reading Papers
Reading papers is not enough for doing research. Firstly, papers usually shed little light on the drawbacks of their methods, so discovering potential improvements could be hard if it seems everything is going well. Secondly, papers focus more on theory and give little instruction on implementing it. In numerical experiments, lots of unexpected problems will arise, but the paper does not instruct how to carefully avoid such problems. So instead of continuously diving into papers, asking a mentor for help is crucial when such problems happen.

## When Things Get Stuck
As an undergraduate, the mentor does not always pay much attention to my projects. Thus, sometimes their instructions might not be helpful. This is the real challenge for me. The wave propagation project raised many unexpected problems when I implemented the program. While the mentor regarded it as a bug in my code, the actual cause turned out to be a small perturbation of the imaginary part during numerical computing, which led to a complete change in the solution. I actually had to deal with lots of unexpected problems on my own. Some turned out to be normal behavior, fully analyzed by truncation error and perturbation theory. For other problems that I have considered really carefully but seem beyond my ability, I seek help from other professors. By sending them emails, I hope some of them may reply.

## Spotting Bugs in Code
Although it is a boring job, it is also a crucial skill in computational mathematics. After spending tons of time finding bugs in code, I have summarized a few methods to help me spot them quickly.

**Test from the simplest case:**  
If the code works for a complex problem, try to derive a simplest case where you have clear expectations for each output. Check the output from each intermediate step to see if it aligns with expectations. If it works well in such a case, gradually add more complex structures. If the code seems correct, but the results are still strange, try analyzing the error introduced by the algorithm, like perturbation theory and truncation error.
