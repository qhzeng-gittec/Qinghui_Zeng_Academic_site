My research journey was often filled with frustration, but also joy of overcoming challenges. My experience in the research field, particularly in applied mathematics, has provided me with numerous opportunities to explore complex problems, navigate obstacles, and develop strategies to overcome them. Through these experiences, I've learned not only the technical skills necessary to conduct research but also the critical thinking and persistence required to push through difficulties. In this blog, I aim to share some of the key challenges I've encountered during my research projects, as well as the strategies and insights I've developed to address them
These experience might be only suitable for undergraduate simple projects, I will consider them more carefully before adoping them in graduate studies. 
## read papers
Reading a large amount of paper is essential before working on a specific project, as it helps build up a comprehensive view of the field of study, and introduce common methods people are using, which is appllicable in my own research project.  
I have summerized some efficient way of reading reserch paper, from my own experience. Below are some of them.
### understanding backgrounds
The backgrounds includes the problems the paper tries to handle, the theoretical results already established in this area, and mathematical tools it uses. 
Oftenly, the mentor would send me papers introducing a new methods. But the paper assumes reader have a well rounded background in area, thus a beginer may really confused. Forexample, When I first reading paper about computing wave transfer problems, I was really confused about the problem setting and the physical backgrounds, like wave number, radiation condition, refection, probagating modes, and incident wave...
And the paper it cited for background reference are also abstruse. To quickly be prepared for the project, I divided these theoretical backgrounds into 2 parts, one is more fundamental mathematical and physcial knowledge, and the other is more advanced knowledge in acoustic studies. Just like the lower and upper division courses in university. The first part is usually more crutial for understanding, because the second part of knowledge are also derived from it. I would search for textbooks and read that particular chapter. Forexample, one paper contains lots of derivation based on Hilbert Space and its innver product. So I look them up in a Functional analysis text book, focusing on the theory, and the detailed proof are omitted for efficiency reason. 
While for the second part of knowledge, they are much harder to grashp. Some actually are courses for those engeneering major students. I once tried to understand every thing i come across. I wanted to derive the distribution of the eigenvalues of stratified Helmholtz operator after perfect matched layer(PML) add had confused me for a long time, I read many papers that span in a long time period from 1970s to 2000s. Later I understood it is a difficult subject, too difficult for an undergraduate. And actually I found it actually is not a key point in my poject, and using the result of that theroy is fine. So I think it is better to simply accept those deep theories sometimes, for efficiency purpose.

### omitted derivation
Many papers, especially in mathematics, omitted some steps during proofing and derivation, maybe the auther consider it is simple. However, if key mathematical tools not in mind, the omitted steps could be obstical. So instead of stucking in it with your own knowledge, consulting the mentor about whether specific math theory should be applied might solve the problem faster. The I have experience such difficulty a few times, at first i thought it was i was not smart enough. But after I asked my mentor for help, it was because a theory I do not know before.

### set priority for papers
A large amount of papers coming every day if the area is developing fast. But not every paper should be read carefully, and only those you think inspiring should be paid more attention to. For the data driven physcis modeling area, it is very popular with many scholars publishing new papers. But a large proportion of them have only limited contribution. My reading strategy for papers in this field is to first scroll thourgh it, examinate the model sturcture and experimental result. then use simple words to summerize its contribution. If I consider it is trivial, then I will no longer consider it too much. But if the methods sounds ingenious, I will further read more about its theoretical back ground, its multivation, and think the reasons for the improvment. Forexample, the the paper of koopman neural operator left me a deep impression. The idea of intergrating koopman operator theroy into machine learning is quite innovative, and let me sees that intergrating mathematical framework properly, could really enhance the mahcine learning performance.
