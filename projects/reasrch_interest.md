### A Few Research Fields I am Interested In


I have been interested in mathematics and physics since high school, and these interests have guided my academic path and research focus. I enjoy the clear structure of mathematics and the way it connects to understanding the physical world through physics. Choosing to study computational mathematics lets me combine both of these fields, using math to solve practical problems in ways that can be useful for society.

**Mathematics**

I have liked mathematics since high school because I found it easier to learn than other subjects. Math has a clear structureâ€”each new theorem builds on earlier ones, making it easier to understand. Unlike other subjects, which often require memorizing unrelated facts, math lets me follow logical steps from simple rules to more complex results. This logical approach makes it reliable; we do not have to doubt the truth of a mathematical theorem if its proof is correct.

In college, I chose to major in computational mathematics and started learning more advanced topics like algebra, real analysis, topology, and differential geometry. These topics were more challenging, with complex proofs and more abstract ideas, but they made me even more interested in mathematics. I began to see how different areas of math connect with each other. For example, the concept of a tangent space, which I first learned about in differential geometry, also appears in topology but in a more abstract form. Seeing how these different areas of math are related gave me a deeper understanding of the subject.

I also like studying math because it allows me to challenge myself. I enjoy thinking deeply about difficult problems and trying to solve them. Sometimes, I spend hours working on a single problem from my textbook. It can be frustrating when I can't find the solution, but when I finally solve it, it feels very rewarding.

Another reason I am interested in math is because of its simplicity and beauty. There is something satisfying about seeing a complex problem solved in a simple way.

**Physics**

My interest in physics started when I was a child and liked to build model planes. I was curious about how planes could fly and which designs would work best. This led me to learn about aerodynamics and sparked my interest in physics. Even though I don't build model planes anymore, I still find physics interesting.

One reason I like physics is that it helps explain how the world works. For example, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact. These equations use math to show the rules that govern our natural world, proving that math is not just abstract but also connected to reality.

Physics also helps me understand math better. For instance, Fourier transformation is a useful method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In physics, this method breaks down complex problems into simpler parts, making it easier to solve them. While some math concepts are hard to understand directly, physics can help by providing a real-world example.

**Applied and Computational Mathematics**

I am specifically interested in applied and computational mathematics because it combines my interests in math and physics. This field uses mathematical tools to solve physics problems, which allows me to work on things I enjoy. Also, research in this area can have practical applications that benefit society, which makes the work feel meaningful.
